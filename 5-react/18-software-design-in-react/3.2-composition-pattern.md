The **React Composition pattern** is a powerful concept that encourages building components by composing them together rather than relying on inheritance. It allows for more reusable, flexible, and manageable code. Below are three examples illustrating different aspects of the composition pattern.

### 1. **Using `children` for Content Composition**

React's `children` prop allows you to pass child elements to a component for rendering. This is useful for building reusable wrapper components.

#### Code Example

```jsx
import React from 'react';

const Card = ({ children }) => {
  return (
    <div style={{ border: '1px solid gray', padding: '20px', borderRadius: '5px' }}>
      {children}
    </div>
  );
};

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <Card>
        <h2>Title</h2>
        <p>This is some content inside the card.</p>
      </Card>
      <Card>
        <button>Click Me!</button>
      </Card>
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```

**Explanation**:  
The `Card` component doesn't dictate what content it displays. Instead, it relies on `children` to render whatever is passed inside the `<Card>` tags.
